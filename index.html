            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean mauris ex, congue sagittis ornare ac, vulputate at massa.</p>
            <p class="secret">But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.</p>

        <div class=card>
            <p>Proin vitae rutrum mi, eget malesuada ipsum. Nulla aliquet nisl eu consectetur pharetra.</p>
            <p class="secret">No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.</p>

        <div class=card>
            <p>Cras et feugiat purus, at rhoncus eros. Mauris non lacus mi. Cras venenatis faucibus ex, eu tincidunt lectus venenatis nec.</p>
            <p class="secret">Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p>

            <p class="secret">To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?</p>

            <p>Curabitur massa sapien, cursus eget tortor id, laoreet ultrices velit. Sed dictum elit lacus, eget suscipit felis volutpat eget.</p>
            <p class="secret">But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
